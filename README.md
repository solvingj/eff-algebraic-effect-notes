## Context

I currently have significant interest in using the Eff monad for modeling programs.  Understanding how to apply Eff to model a program has a significant amount of prerequisite knowledge and experience with Monads and functional programming. This repository is intended to capture my own thoughts and perceptions about Eff, coming from an object-oriented and imperative programming background.  The goal is then to use this repository to share these thoughts with more experienced FP mavens, so they can perhaps better advise me as I try to employ Eff along with some other monads. 

## Resources

So far, the best source of information I have found regarding Eff is this github repository:  
	https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography

This contains links to the talks and works that originally got me interested in Eff, which are those of Daan Leijen, Eric Torreborre, and now Nick Palladinos.  Of course, it also contains the foundational works of Plotkin, Pretnar, and Moggi. 

## Further Discussion

I am very interested in discussing the topic with others, so please feel free to reach out to me via email, or via chat (see below). 

There is a great slack workspace for functional programming in general:  https://functionalprogramming.slack.com

The signup page isi currently here:  https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/

There is now a channel specifically for this topic called `#algebraic-effects`
